                  <p class="card-text">Hirohiko Araki (荒木 飛呂彦, Araki Hirohiko, born June 7, 1960) is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for his long-running series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which began publication in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1987 and has over 120 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Poses</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Because characters' poses can reveal much about them, down to what emotions they are feeling, poses are an incredibly important element of drawing. This is what Araki said when asked about the poses.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Art Style</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Araki's art is unique where the shading is done where it really defines the face of some of the characters. This shading however is less prominent in Araki's later parts of Jojo. Araki's coloring is also very unique where in certain scenes, the color has changed and it gives the moments a more dramatic feeling to it. Araki's character designs are also very notable where you can tell a character is from his series through the outfit. The outfits he gives his characters are very unique and not the traditional outfits you would see in other series or in real life. The characters also have these abilities which make his story different from others. These abilities aren't exactly spoken or given to the viewers immediately which really makes the viewers think about how these abilities work. These abilities can get really complicated where it gets really confusing and has viewers think and discus what these abilities do. This gives the series a sense of mystery and logic to it.  All these things that Araki does I love and what me really hooked into jojo and his other works.</p>

                <p>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a 9 part series which is also the manga that got Araki famous for. His style of art and poses is what drew people to the series. The series being broken down into multiple parts with different characters allows Araki to really build up the series. he fixes what the other parts lack and continues to build on that each part. Jojo's part 7 is the second best manga out there just being under Berserk.  </p>

                  <p>This manga series was the first time using gore and profanity in the story and art style. This would build the foundation for how Araki's type of story telling and style will lead into for Jojo's bizzare Adventure. </p>
